# ruvectorignore — excludes files from bulk indexing (same syntax as .gitignore)
# Note: post-edit hooks do not consult this file — the path guard in
# plugins/yellow-ruvector/hooks/scripts/post-tool-use.sh handles incremental
# exclusion for vector memory operations.

# Solution docs are indexed explicitly via the reflexion namespace by
# learning-compounder — exclude from the code namespace (bulk indexing only).
