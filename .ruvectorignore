# ruvectorignore — excludes files from bulk indexing (same syntax as .gitignore)
# Note: post-edit incremental indexing does NOT consult this file (verified 2026-02-24).
# The path guard in plugins/yellow-ruvector/hooks/scripts/post-tool-use.sh handles
# incremental exclusion.

# Solution docs are indexed explicitly via the reflexion namespace by
# learning-compounder — exclude from the code namespace (bulk indexing only).
