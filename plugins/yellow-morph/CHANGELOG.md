## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- [`40f6767`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/40f67673bca785741114c05aba73b8445e20ce72)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - Apply
  mechanical audit followups (2026-05-07 audit):
  - **C-02 (yellow-core):** update three legacy 2-segment `subagent_type:`
    references in `commands/workflows/plan.md` lines 90/98/132 to the 3-segment
    runtime form (`yellow-core:research:repo-research-analyst`,
    `yellow-core:research:best-practices-researcher`,
    `yellow-core:workflow:spec-flow-analyzer`). Clears three INFO warnings from
    `pnpm validate:agents`.
  - **M-02 (yellow-morph):** mark `hooks/scripts/prewarm-morph.sh` as
    executable. The hook already worked because `bash script.sh` was the
    invocation form, but the missing `+x` bit raised a WARNING in
    `pnpm validate:schemas`.
  - **C-01 (gt-workflow):** document the un-namespaced command convention
    exception in `CLAUDE.md`. The seven gt-workflow commands ship without the
    `namespace:verb` prefix intentionally — they predate the namespacing
    convention. No behavior change; documentation only.

  Companion to PR #436 (X-02 validator fix) and the broader audit followups plan
  at `plans/audit-followups-2026-05-07.md`.

- [`9977b28`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/9977b280f2fab42d4c4627dc2ead0d4d09331d45)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - H-01 (audit
  2026-05-07): run yellow-morph SessionStart prewarm in a detached background
  subshell. The previous synchronous form held the session-start critical path
  for up to 30s while `npm ci` installed `@morphllm/morphmcp` into
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/node_modules/` — single largest user-visible perf cost
  in the marketplace.

  The refactored hook spawns the install work in a detached subshell
  (`( ... ) >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`) and yields to Claude Code in <10ms on the
  parent. The subshell owns the install lock and trap-releases on EXIT, so the
  parent's early exit does not orphan the lock. SessionStart timeout reduced
  from 30s to 5s in `plugin.json` and `hooks/hooks.json` (both kept in sync per
  drift check).

  **Trade-off:** if the user invokes a morph tool within ~30s of session start
  on a slow connection, they may still hit a cold cache — `bin/start-morph.sh`
  runs install synchronously as the correctness fallback. The hook is purely an
  optimization; missing the async window is no worse than not having the hook at
  all.

  Companion: also marks `prewarm-morph.sh` executable (M-02 backport — the chmod
  also lands in PR #437; this PR carries it because PR 3 branched off main,
  parallel topology).

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [`d877603`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/d877603f548d2154e590eb8fad393bc298beed30)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - Fix
  `hooks/hooks.json` shape so Claude Code 2.1.131+ can load the plugin's
  `SessionStart` prewarm hook.

  The reference file had `SessionStart` at the top level instead of nested under
  a `"hooks"` key. Recent Claude Code releases auto-discover and validate
  `hooks/hooks.json` against `{ hooks: Record<EventName, …> }`, so the plugin
  failed `/doctor` with
  `Hook load failed: expected "record", received undefined at path ["hooks"]`.
  The inline `hooks` block in `plugin.json` is unchanged; only the reference
  file was rewrapped to match the schema and the shape used by every other
  plugin in this repo (gt-workflow, yellow-ci, yellow-debt, yellow-ruvector).

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#386](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/pull/386)
  [`8496a31`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/8496a313eec4e9c0953357f6365dee760dfdc3c2)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - # Fix
  `userConfig` manifest validator drift — add required `type` and `title`

  Add `"type": "string"` and `"title": "<sentence-case label>"` to every
  `userConfig` entry in the four plugins that declared user-supplied
  credentials. The Claude Code remote validator (surfaced via `claude doctor`)
  rejects any `userConfig` entry missing either field; local CI was passing
  because `schemas/plugin.schema.json` made `type` optional and used `label`
  instead of `title`.

  Affected entries (7 total):
  - `yellow-devin`: `devin_service_user_token`, `devin_org_id`
  - `yellow-research`: `perplexity_api_key`, `tavily_api_key`, `exa_api_key`
  - `yellow-morph`: `morph_api_key`
  - `yellow-semgrep`: `semgrep_app_token`

  Companion changes outside the plugins (no changeset needed — repo root):
  - `schemas/plugin.schema.json` — `userConfigEntry` tightened: `type` and
    `title` now required, `type` enum extended with `directory` and `file`
    (parity with remote validator), unused `label` property removed, dead
    `allOf` branch (the `if not required type` fall-through) removed,
    `directory`/`file` default-type-string constraint branches added.
  - `scripts/validate-plugin.js` — RULE 9 added: hand-rolled `userConfig`
    enforcement (per-entry `type` enum check + `title` non-empty string check).
    The repo's local CI does not currently AJV-load `plugin.schema.json`, so
    script-level enforcement is what actually catches this drift before
    `claude doctor`.
  - `docs/solutions/build-errors/userconfig-type-title-remote-validator-drift.md`
    — new solutions doc cross-referencing the prior `changelog`/`repository`
    drift incidents.

  **Behavior change for users:** `sensitive: true` (or `false` for
  `devin_org_id`) is preserved verbatim — keychain storage and credential
  masking are unchanged. The new `title` field is a UI label only; it never
  carries the credential value. Plugin install behavior is unchanged for
  existing users; the change unblocks fresh installs that hit the strict remote
  validator.

### Minor Changes

- [`4d034f2`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/4d034f26117da84d15707094fe8970210ad76bee)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - yellow-morph:
  migrate Morph API key from shell `MORPH_API_KEY` to plugin `userConfig`
  (Claude Code prompts at plugin-enable time and stores in the system keychain).
  Shell `MORPH_API_KEY` remains supported as a power-user fallback. Ship
  `bin/start-morph.sh` wrapper and a SessionStart prewarm hook that install
  `@morphllm/morphmcp@0.8.165` into `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` — serialized via an
  atomic `mkdir`-lock so wrapper and hook cannot run concurrent `npm ci`. Fix
  `ENABLED_TOOLS` no-op (morphmcp ignores it; switch to
  `DISABLED_TOOLS=github_codebase_search`). Correct WarpGrep tool name from the
  non-existent `warpgrep_codebase_search` to `codebase_search`.

  yellow-core: update `setup:all` classification probe so yellow-morph is
  detected via the renamed `codebase_search` tool, and refresh the
  mcp-integration-patterns skill to reference the new tool name.

  yellow-research: rename the `filesystem-with-morph` global MCP probe in
  `/research:setup` to `codebase_search` (current name), with
  `warpgrep_codebase_search` retained in `allowed-tools` as a backward-
  compatibility hedge for users still on an older global MCP version.

- [`4d034f2`](https://github.com/KingInYellows/yellow-plugins/commit/4d034f26117da84d15707094fe8970210ad76bee)
  Thanks [@KingInYellow18](https://github.com/KingInYellow18)! - Hardening of
  the @morphllm/morphmcp install path:
  - Extract shared install primitives into
    `plugins/yellow-morph/lib/install-morphmcp.sh` (path validation, mkdir-lock,
    npm ci wrapper, cleanup). `bin/start-morph.sh`,
    `hooks/scripts/prewarm-morph.sh`, and `/morph:setup` Step 3 now source the
    lib instead of each carrying its own copy of the install protocol — single
    source of truth for the install contract.
  - Add stale-lock recovery to the mkdir install lock: each holder writes its
    PID into `$LOCK_DIR/pid` on acquisition. Subsequent acquirers detect a dead
    owner via `kill -0` and clear the lock once before retrying. Recovers
    automatically from SIGKILL / OOM of a prior holder instead of forcing 20s of
    timeout-then-manual-cleanup on every later install.
  - Tighten the npm ci environment from `unset MORPH_API_KEY` to `env -i` with
    an explicit allowlist (HOME, PATH, NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG,
    NPM_CONFIG_GLOBALCONFIG, NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX). Postinstall scripts in
    transitive deps no longer inherit any session secrets — not just
    MORPH_API_KEY but also ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, and anything else
    exported into Claude Code's process environment.

All notable changes to this plugin are documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (breaking)

- **Config surface: `MORPH_API_KEY` now read from `userConfig`, not shell env.**
  Claude Code prompts for the key at plugin-enable time and stores it in the
  system keychain (or `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on minimal Linux). Fresh
  installs no longer require a `MORPH_API_KEY` export before launching Claude
  Code, and no longer require a Claude Code restart after setup. Power-user
  fallback via a shell `MORPH_API_KEY` export is also supported in 1.1.0 —
  `bin/start-morph.sh` resolves the userConfig value first, then falls through
  to the shell env var when userConfig is empty.
- **MCP pin bumped from `@morphllm/morphmcp@0.8.110` to `0.8.165`** (55 versions
  of upstream fixes).

### Fixed

- **`edit_file` tool was silently disabled.** morphmcp disables `edit_file` by
  default; the plugin had been setting the (non-existent) `ENABLED_TOOLS` env
  var, which is silently ignored. Switched to
  `DISABLED_TOOLS=github_codebase_search` so both `edit_file` and
  `codebase_search` (the two tools the plugin advertises) are now actually
  exposed.
- **Tool name corrected: `warpgrep_codebase_search` → `codebase_search`.** The
  `warpgrep_` prefix does not exist in morphmcp 0.8.165. References updated
  across CLAUDE.md, README, `/morph:status`, and the `mcp-integration-patterns`
  skill. The `mcp__plugin_yellow-morph_morph__edit_file` and
  `mcp__plugin_yellow-morph_morph__codebase_search` names are what agents should
  call going forward.

### Migration

- Existing users: run `claude plugin update yellow-morph@yellow-plugins`. Claude
  Code detects the new `userConfig` field and prompts for the key on next plugin
  enable. Answer the prompt to migrate.
- If your prior setup relied on
  `mcp__plugin_yellow-morph_morph__warpgrep_codebase_search`, agents invoking
  the old name will fail — update the call site to
  `mcp__plugin_yellow-morph_morph__codebase_search`.
