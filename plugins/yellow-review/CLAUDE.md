# yellow-review Plugin

Multi-agent PR review with adaptive agent selection, parallel comment
resolution, and sequential stack review. Graphite-native workflow.

## Conventions

- Use Graphite (`gt`) for all branch management and PR creation — never raw
  `git push` or `gh pr create`
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`
- Agents report findings — they do NOT edit project files directly. The
  `memory: project` frontmatter auto-enables Read/Write/Edit per Claude Code
  docs (so agents can persist learnings to `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/`),
  but the prompt-level "report findings only" rule remains in force; the
  orchestrating command applies all fixes
- Orchestrating commands apply fixes sequentially to avoid conflicts
- All shell scripts follow POSIX security patterns (quoted variables, input
  validation, `set -eu`)
- Working directory must be clean before running any review command
- Commit messages: `fix: address review findings from <agents>` or
  `fix: resolve PR #<num> review comments`
- Always confirm with user via `AskUserQuestion` before pushing changes — never
  auto-push without human approval. **Exceptions** (commands that intentionally
  run unattended and suppress every push gate by design):
  - `/review:resolve-stack` — walks a Graphite stack invoking
    `/review:resolve --non-interactive` per PR
  - `/review:sweep` — invokes `/review:pr --non-interactive` then
    `/review:resolve --non-interactive` on a single PR with no gates
  - `/review:sweep-all` — loops `/review:sweep` over every open non-draft PR
    you authored; only the one upfront M3 confirmation is interactive
  
  The default `/review:pr` and `/review:resolve` paths (no flag) keep every
  gate. The `--non-interactive` flag opts a single invocation in to the
  unattended behavior.

## Plugin Components

### Commands (7)

- `/review:setup` — Validate GitHub, jq, Graphite, and optional yellow-core
  integration before reviewing PRs
- `/review:pr` — Adaptive multi-agent review of a single PR with automatic fix
  application. Accepts `--non-interactive` to suppress its Step 9
  push-confirmation prompt and its Step 9b "save learnings" prompt (used by
  `/review:sweep`)
- `/review:resolve` — Parallel resolution of unresolved PR review comments via
  GraphQL. Accepts `--non-interactive` to suppress its spawn-cap, CONFLICT, and
  push-confirmation gates (used by `/review:resolve-stack` and `/review:sweep`)
- `/review:resolve-stack` — Walk the current Graphite stack bottom-up and run
  `/review:resolve --non-interactive` on every open PR fully autonomously (no
  prompts), pushing and restacking as it goes
- `/review:all` — Sequential review of multiple PRs (Graphite stack, all open,
  or single PR)
- `/review:sweep` — Wrapper that runs `/review:pr --non-interactive` then
  `/review:resolve --non-interactive` on the same PR with no gates in
  between — fully unattended
- `/review:sweep-all` — Run `/review:sweep` on every open non-draft PR you
  authored sequentially, with one upfront confirmation, skip-and-continue per
  PR, end-of-loop summary, and a single `/workflows:compound` pass at the end

### Agents (16)

**Review** — parallel code analysis specialists (report findings, do NOT edit):

- `project-compliance-reviewer` — CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md compliance, naming,
  project-pattern adherence (always selected; renamed from `code-reviewer`
  in Wave 2)
- `correctness-reviewer` — Logic errors, edge cases, state bugs, error
  propagation (always selected; new in Wave 2)
- `maintainability-reviewer` — Premature abstraction, dead code, coupling,
  naming (always selected; new in Wave 2)
- `reliability-reviewer` — Production reliability: error handling, retries,
  timeouts, cascades (selected when diff touches I/O/async; new in Wave 2)
- `project-standards-reviewer` — Frontmatter, references, cross-platform
  portability (always selected; new in Wave 2; complements
  `project-compliance-reviewer`)
- `adversarial-reviewer` — Constructed failure scenarios across boundaries
  (selected for diffs >200 lines or trust boundaries; new in Wave 2)
- `plugin-contract-reviewer` — Breaking changes to plugin public surface
  (subagent_type renames, command/skill/MCP-tool renames, manifest field
  changes, hook contract changes); selected when diff touches
  `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/*/agents/**/*.md`,
  `plugins/*/commands/**/*.md`, `plugins/*/skills/**/SKILL.md`, or
  `plugins/*/hooks/`. Sister to `pattern-recognition-specialist`
  (yellow-core) — pattern-rec catches new convention drift,
  plugin-contract catches breaks to existing surface. New in Wave 3.
- `cli-readiness-reviewer` — Conditional persona that reviews CLI command
  surface for autonomous-agent invocability (interactive prompts without
  bypass, missing structured output, vague errors, unsafe retries, ANSI
  in pipes). Selected on the same plugin-authoring globs as
  `plugin-contract-reviewer`; concerns are disjoint. New in Wave 3.
- `agent-cli-readiness-reviewer` — Conditional persona using a 7-principle
  Blocker/Friction/Optimization rubric for CLI agent-readiness (non-interactive
  defaults, structured output, actionable errors, safe retries, bounded
  output, composability, discoverability). Adapted from upstream CE
  v3.3.2; deeper than `cli-readiness-reviewer` for design-doc audits and
  full-CLI evaluations. New in Wave 3.
- `agent-native-reviewer` — Conditional persona reviewing agent-native
  parity: every UI action has an agent tool equivalent, agents see the
  same data users see, shared workspace, primitives over workflows,
  dynamic context injection. Adapted from upstream CE v3.3.2. References
  `yellow-core:agent-native-architecture` and
  `yellow-core:agent-native-audit` skills. New in Wave 3.
- `pr-test-analyzer` — Test coverage and behavioral completeness
- `comment-analyzer` — Comment accuracy and rot detection
- `code-simplifier` — Simplification preserving functionality (runs as final
  pass)
- `type-design-analyzer` — Type design, encapsulation, invariants
- `silent-failure-hunter` — Silent failure and error handling analysis

**Workflow** — orchestration helpers:

- `pr-comment-resolver` — Implements fix for a single review comment (spawned in
  parallel)

### Skills (2)

- `pr-review-workflow` — Internal reference for adaptive selection, output
  format, error handling, and Graphite integration (not user-invokable)
- `stack-traversal` — Internal reference for the bottom-up Graphite
  stack-traversal procedure shared by `/review:all` and
  `/review:resolve-stack` (not user-invokable)

### Scripts (2)

- `get-pr-comments` — Fetch unresolved, non-outdated PR review threads via
  GitHub GraphQL API
- `resolve-pr-thread` — Resolve a single review thread via GitHub GraphQL
  mutation

## When to Use What

- **`/review:setup`** — First install, after auth issues, or when review
  commands fail before agent analysis begins.
- **`/review:pr`** — Review a single PR with adaptive agent selection. Best for
  focused reviews of individual changes.
- **`/review:resolve`** — Address pending review comments on a single PR. Run
  after receiving feedback to fix and mark threads resolved. Keeps its
  spawn-cap and push-confirmation gates for interactive use.
- **`/review:resolve-stack`** — Resolve comments across an entire Graphite
  stack in one unattended pass. Walks base → tip, runs `/review:resolve` per PR
  with gates suppressed, pushes and restacks autonomously. Best when you have
  review feedback spread across a multi-PR stack and want it all cleared
  without per-PR prompts. Distinct from `/review:all scope=stack` (which runs
  the full review + resolve pipeline per PR) — `resolve-stack` is resolve-only.
- **`/review:all scope=stack`** — Review entire Graphite stack in dependency
  order (base → tip). Best before submitting a stack for review.
- **`/review:all scope=all`** — Batch-review all your open non-draft PRs. Best
  for catching up on review backlog.
- **`/review:sweep`** — Run `/review:pr --non-interactive` then
  `/review:resolve --non-interactive` sequentially on a single PR with no
  gates anywhere. Best when you want both an AI review pass and cleanup of
  any open bot/human comment threads in one fire-and-forget invocation.
- **`/review:sweep-all`** — Loop `/review:sweep` over every open non-draft
  PR you authored, sequentially. One upfront M3 confirmation shows the PR
  list; after Proceed, runs unattended end-to-end. Skip-and-continue on
  per-PR failure, summary table, and an end-of-loop `/workflows:compound`
  pass to capture learnings. Best for clearing review + resolve backlog
  across multiple open PRs at once. Distinct from `/review:all scope=all`
  (which runs the deeper review pipeline per PR with per-PR push gates) —
  `sweep-all` is the lighter, fully-unattended batch alternative.
- **`/workflows:review`** (yellow-core) — Session-level review against a plan
  file. Evaluates plan adherence, cross-PR coherence, and scope drift.
  Complementary to `/review:pr` (per-PR code quality) — use both for full
  coverage.

## Cross-Plugin Agent References

When conditions warrant, commands spawn these agents via Task tool (using
the three-segment `yellow-core:<dir>:<name>` subagent_type — e.g.
`yellow-core:review:security-reviewer`). The Wave 2 pipeline dispatches the
calibrated reviewer variants; the legacy fallback (`review_pipeline:
legacy` in `yellow-plugins.local.md`) keeps the deeper-audit variants.

- `security-reviewer` — for auth, crypto, and shell-script changes (Wave 2
  default; the deeper-audit `security-sentinel` is the legacy fallback)
- `architecture-strategist` — for large (10+ file) cross-module changes
- `performance-reviewer` — for query-heavy or high-line-count PRs (Wave 2
  default; the deeper-audit `performance-oracle` is the legacy fallback)
- `pattern-recognition-specialist` — for new pattern introductions and
  plugin authoring convention checks
- `code-simplicity-reviewer` — additional simplification pass for large PRs

Optional supplementary agent via Task tool (using the three-segment
`yellow-codex:review:codex-reviewer` subagent_type):

- `codex-reviewer` — parallel review when yellow-codex is installed AND
  diff > 100 lines. Tags findings with `[codex]`. Silently skipped when
  yellow-codex is not installed.

yellow-review requires yellow-core for full review coverage. Without it,
cross-plugin agents (security-reviewer / security-sentinel,
architecture-strategist, performance-reviewer / performance-oracle,
pattern-recognition-specialist, code-simplicity-reviewer) silently
degrade — only yellow-review's own agents run.

### MCP Tool Integration

- **ruvector** — Recall past learnings at workflow start; tiered remember at
  workflow end (Auto for P0/P1 findings, Prompted for P2). Graceful skip if
  yellow-ruvector not installed.
- **morph** — Preferred for intent-based code search (blast radius, callers,
  similar patterns) in review agents. Discovered via ToolSearch at runtime;
  falls back to built-in Grep silently.
- **ast-grep** (yellow-research) — Optional structural code search for
  silent-failure-hunter and type-design-analyzer. Discovered via ToolSearch at
  runtime; falls back to Grep if yellow-research not installed.

## Known Limitations

- GraphQL scripts require `gh` and `jq` to be installed
- Cross-plugin agents require the `yellow-core` plugin to be installed
- Very large PRs (1000+ lines) may cause agent context overflow — consider
  splitting
- Draft PRs are excluded from `/review:all scope=all` by default
- `gt track` may fail on non-Graphite PRs — falls back to raw git (degraded
  mode)
